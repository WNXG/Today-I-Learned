> ToDay I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really warrant a full blog post. These are things I've picked up by Learning In Public™ and pairing with smart people at Hashrocket.

>  这是一本关于我每天通过各种语言和技术学习的小事情的简明总结集。这些事情并不能真正保证一篇完整的博客文章。这些都是我在公共场合学到的东西™ 在Hashrocket与聪明人配对。
